# Backend - Sustainability Intelligence Platform

This directory contains the backend API and services for the Sustainability Intelligence Platform - a comprehensive system that processes and analyzes sustainability data to provide actionable insights for achieving net zero goals.

## Overview

The backend serves as the data processing engine that transforms raw sustainability data into meaningful insights. It handles data ingestion, processing, analysis, and serves the processed data to the frontend through a RESTful API.

## Technology Stack

*To be updated based on chosen backend framework*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

*To be updated based on chosen backend framework*

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the Backend directory
3. Create a virtual environment (if using Python):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   # or
   npm install
   ```

### Development

Start the development server:
```bash
python app.py
# or
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`

## API Endpoints

*To be updated as endpoints are implemented*

### Core Endpoints

- `GET /api/health` - Health check
- `GET /api/sustainability/metrics` - Get sustainability metrics
- `POST /api/sustainability/data` - Upload sustainability data
- `GET /api/analytics/insights` - Get data insights
- `GET /api/netzero/progress` - Get net zero progress

### Data Processing

- `POST /api/process/upload` - Process uploaded data
- `GET /api/process/status/{id}` - Get processing status
- `GET /api/process/results/{id}` - Get processing results

## Data Models

*To be updated as models are defined*

### Sustainability Metrics
- Carbon footprint data
- Energy consumption
- Waste generation
- Water usage
- Supply chain emissions

### Net Zero Tracking
- Baseline emissions
- Reduction targets
- Progress milestones
- Action plans

## Database

*To be updated based on chosen database*

The backend uses a database to store:
- Sustainability data
- User configurations
- Processing results
- Historical trends

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root of the Backend directory:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_database_url
API_KEY=your_api_key
DEBUG=True
PORT=8000
# Add other environment variables as needed
```

## Data Processing Pipeline

1. **Data Ingestion**: Receive data from various sources
2. **Validation**: Validate data format and completeness
3. **Processing**: Apply algorithms and calculations
4. **Analysis**: Generate insights and recommendations
5. **Storage**: Store processed data and results
6. **API Response**: Serve data to frontend

## Testing

Run tests:
```bash
pytest
# or
npm test
```

## API Documentation

API documentation will be available at `http://localhost:8000/docs` when the development server is running.

## Contributing

1. Follow the established code style
2. Write comprehensive tests
3. Update API documentation
4. Ensure all tests pass before submitting

## License

*To be updated based on project license*
