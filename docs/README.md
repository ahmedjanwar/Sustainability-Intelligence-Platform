## 🎬 Demo Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
"Good [morning/afternoon] judges! I'm excited to present GreenView Copilot, our sustainability intelligence platform that makes the invisible visible by transforming complex data into actionable insights."

### Problem Statement (45 seconds)
"Organizations today struggle with scattered sustainability data across multiple systems. They have energy consumption here, emissions data there, waste metrics somewhere else. There's no single source of truth, no clear way to understand their overall sustainability performance, and no AI-powered guidance on how to improve."

### Solution Overview (60 seconds)
"GreenView Copilot solves this by providing a single sustainability score from 0 to 100, interactive dashboards that visualize all your data in one place, and an AI copilot that answers questions like 'Where are my highest emissions?' in natural language. You can also run what-if simulations to see how changes would impact your score."

### Live Demo (3 minutes)
**Step 1 - Upload Data (30 seconds)**
"Let me show you how it works. I'll upload a sample sustainability dataset..."

[Upload CSV file, show validation and preview]

**Step 2 - Dashboard (60 seconds)**
"Instantly, we get a comprehensive dashboard with our sustainability score of 73 out of 100. Here we can see our emissions breakdown, energy consumption trends, and waste generation patterns. Everything is interactive and real-time."

**Step 3 - AI Copilot (90 seconds)**
"Now for the magic - our AI copilot. Let me ask it a question: 'Where are my highest emissions?'"

[Show AI response with insights and recommendations]

"The AI not only tells us that transportation accounts for 45% of our emissions, but it also suggests specific actions like switching to electric vehicles and optimizing delivery routes."

**Step 4 - What-If Simulation (60 seconds)**
"Let's test a scenario. What if we switch 30% of our fleet to electric vehicles?"

[Run simulation, show score update]

"Our score jumps from 73 to 81! The system shows us exactly how this change impacts each category and provides a clear ROI calculation."

### Closing (30 seconds)
"GreenView Copilot transforms sustainability from a complex reporting exercise into an intuitive, AI-powered decision-making tool. We're making the invisible visible, one dataset at a time. Thank you!"
